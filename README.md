# Improved Soil Moisture Sensor [v1.0]

This project aims at making the soil moisture sensor project more practical (not necessarily cheaper) than the original that has been done many times with a few LED indicators. To try and improve it, the LEDs are replaced by a 3.2" touchscreen display that can switch between plants depending on the amount of soil moisture sensors connected. Additionally, it can display the approximate temperature and humidity of the room as well as auto-water your plant by tipping over a small cup of water when attached to the servo. The touchscreen displays the temperature, humidity, and current soil moisture level of the plants, indicated by the 4 status' Wet, Damp, Moist, and Dry and an image of a plant that becomes more or less blue depending on the status.

Materials
=========
**Original Project:**
* 1 x [Arduino UNO R3](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
* 4 x 220ohm Resistors
* 4 x LEDs (2 Green and 2 Red, or some way to differentiate Wet or Dry)

**Improved Project:**
* 1 x [3.2‚Äù TFT LCD with Touchscreen Breakout Board w/microSD socket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1743)
* 1 x SG90 Micro Servo
* 1 x Small Plastic Cup (I just used a smaller than normal red solo cup)
* 1 x Servo Attachment (To tip the cup and not spill water everywhere)
* 1 x [Elegoo MEGA 2560 R3](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01H4ZLZLQ) (Note: An Arduino instead of an Elegoo will work, it's just more expensive)
* 1 x DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)

**Materials In Common:**
* Several Jumper Wires (20 - 40)
* Breadboard
* 2 x [Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensors v1.2](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07H3P1NRM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Several Male Header Pins

I bought a [ELEGOO UNO Project Super Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.ca/Elegoo-Project-Starter-Tutorial-Arduino/dp/B01D8KOZF4), which contained a lot of the components such as the Jumper Wires, Breadboard, Header Pins, DHT11, SG90 Micro Servo, Resistors, UNO R3, and LEDs.

Requirements
============

### Original Project:
None yay!

### Improved Project:
**Arduino Libraries:**
* Wire - Standard Library (just include it)
* Servo - Standard Library (just include it)
* [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) 
* [Adafruit TFTLCD](https://github.com/adafruit/TFTLCD-Library)
* [Adafruit Touchscreen](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TouchScreen)
* [Adafruit DHT](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library)

**Software:**
  * [Img2Code](https://github.com/ehubin/Adafruit-GFX-Library/tree/master/Img2Code) - Adafruit Java Application that allows you to convert from a BMP image to code.
    * Resource on how to use it - [Electronics Lab Tutorial](https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/display-custom-bitmap-graphics-on-an-arduino-touch-screen-and-other-arduino-compatible-displays/)
    * I had some issues running this program (on Windows at least). I had to create a gradle.properties file in the Img2Code folder downloaded from the GitHUb, and point it to my JDK with "org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_191". After this, I ran the ./gradlew build and then ./gradlew run in the cmd prompt in the Img2Code directory and it worked. If you run into problems, the GitHub doesn't tell you any of this though, so if there is any other software for convering from a BMP image to code then don't be afraid to try it.
 

Build Instructions
==================
### Original Project:
For this project, you can use an UNO or a Mega. Fair warning that this project does not translate very well to the improved version. The point of setting this project up is to test the Mega, and the Soil Moisture Sensors and establish some simpler code to work off of.

#### Wiring:
* Wire the negative legs of the green LEDs to digital pins 3 and 5, and the red LEDs to digital pins 2 and 4. 
* Having some resistors (220ohm) connected to each of the positive legs of the LEDs is a good idea, just so they don't burn out as fast. The other side of the resistor should go to ground.
* The AOUT (Analog Out) pins on the soil moisture sensors should be connected to pins A0 and A1. Then the VCC's to 5V, and GND's to the GND.
* More details including diagrams (except for the above specified digital and analog pins to connect to) can be found [here](https://www.elithecomputerguy.com/2019/07/soil-moisture-sensor-led-alert-with-arduino-uno/), where the project was originally obtained from. Code for the idea of splitting the soil moisture values into 4 (Dry, Damp, Moist, and Dry) can be found [here](https://github.com/GadgetReboot/Arduino/blob/master/Uno/SSD1306_Soil_Meter/SSD1306_Soil_Meter.ino)

### Improved Project:
Now we get into the improvements. Like I mentioned in the Original Project's build instructions, almost everything changes except that we use the Mega and Soil Moisture Sensors.

#### Part Setup & Prep Work:
* The first step, is to solder on some male header pins to the 8-bit side of the 3.2" TFT Touchscreen. Be careful that it's not the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) side. [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-dot-8-color-tft-touchscreen-breakout-v2/pinouts) has great detailed information about the differences between the two, but essentially it comes down to speed and how many pins you have. Since we have the Mega, we don't have to worry about using more pins so 8-bit mode is what is used for this project. SPI uses less pins, but it's 2 - 4 times slower than 8-bit mode at updating the touchscreen display.
  * Note: One problem encountered was that the pins weren't soldered well enough, which caused some issues when testing if the touchscreen was connected and working.

* Next, the servo needs 3 male header pins.
* Lastly, attach a servo attachment to a red solo cup. I suggest zip ties and glue to ensure that the attachment stays in-place, so it remains securely attached to the cup while being tipped.
